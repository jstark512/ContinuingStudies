## Module 1
Files Used -

- `movies.csv`: Contains movie titles and genres.
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for each movie.

What The Script Does -
1. Loads the movie and rating data using Pandas
2. Checks for missing values and duplicates
3. Cleans the dataset by removing those values
4. Merges the two datasets for analysis
5. Uses Pandas and NumPy to compute:
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Top-rated and most-rated movies

The ReadMe in the Module 1 folder was downloaded with the files from Kaggle
